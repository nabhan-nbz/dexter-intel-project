Although access to professional help and mental health resources is crucial for general well-being, many people still face barriers in this regard. Seeking help might be hampered by a lack of mental health specialists, and lengthy wait times. By using natural language understanding (NLU) to create an interactive chatbot, users can get help instantly, lessen the strain on mental health services, and use a private platform to ask for help.
We successfully developed a chatbot named Dexter, aimed at providing mental health awareness and support using NLP echniques with the Transformers library and Hugging Face models, we fine-tuned our model to understand and respond to user queries effectively.We used HTML and CSS for our frontend design to create an easy-to-use interface, and Python was used for backend tasks like data processing and server management. We developed a user-friendly platform that improves access to mental health resources and assistance by integrating these technologies.
